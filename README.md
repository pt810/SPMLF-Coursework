# **Signal Processing and Machine Learning for Finance (SPMLF) Coursework**

Welcome to the **SPMLF Coursework** repository. This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to the analyses and computations performed for the coursework.

## **Overview**

In this coursework, I apply signal processing and machine learning techniques to financial data. The main focus of the analysis is documented in the following files:

- **`spmlf_report.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing both the report on the conducted analyses, and the code used to perform the relevant computations and plot the relevant data visualisations. 

- **`spmlf_report.html`**: A pre-rendered version of the notebook for easy viewing. If you only want to read the report and understand the results without running the code, this file should provide everything you need.

## Usage

### Viewing the Report
To review the results and analyses without running any code, simply open the **`spmlf_report.html`** file in your browser. This will give you a complete view of the report, including explanations, visualisations, and results.

### Running the Code
If you'd like to rerun or modify the code:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open **`spmlf_report.ipynb`** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analyses and visualisations.

## Coursework Tasks

The tasks in this coursework are based on the outline provided in the *Tasks.pdf* document. The notebook follows these tasks sequentially.

## **Work Summary**

*	Developed ARIMA and VAR models to forecast stock prices and analyse relationships between financial assets, supporting portfolio optimisation.
*	Conducted time-series analysis and applied logarithmic returns for financial data preprocessing, improving model accuracy and reliability.
*	Implemented adaptive minimum-variance portfolio optimisation, recalculating risk with covariance matrices to enhance decision-making.
*	Applied PCA and robust regression techniques (OLS and Huber) to design outlier-resistant trading strategies and improve financial predictions using Python.
